// Create a variable of type string and try to add a number to it.

let str = "Hello";
let result = str + 5;
console.log(result); // Output: Hello5

//Explanation:

//n JavaScript, when you add a string and a number using the + operator, the number is converted to a string.

//So "Hello" + 5 becomes "Hello5" â€” this is called type coercion.
